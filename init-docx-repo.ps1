# "pre-commit-git-diff-docx.sh:" Small git (https://git-scm.com/)
# hook. It works in combination with another hook,
# "post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh".
#
# Together, they keep a Markdown (.md) copy of .docx files so that git
# diffs of the .md files show the changes in the document (as .docx
# files are binaries, they produce no diffs that can be checked in
# emails or in the repository's commit page).
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES
#
# post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh
# pandoc (http://pandoc.org/)
#
#
# DETAILS:
#
# This script makes a Markdown format copy (.md) of any .docx files in
# the commit. It then lists the .md file names in a temp file called
# .commit-amend-markdown.
#
# After the commit, the post-commit hook
# "post-commit-git-diff-docx.sh" will check for this file. If it
# exists, it will amend the commit adding the names of the .md files.
#
# The reason why we cannot simply add the .md files here is because
# `git add` adds files to the next commit, not the current one.
#
# This script requires pandoc (http://pandoc.org/) to have been
# installed in the system.
